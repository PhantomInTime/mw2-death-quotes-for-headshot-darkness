## MW2 Death Quotes for Headshot Darkness
This is just a json file containing the quotes you see when you die in OG MW2 that will overwrite the custom death strings file for the mod Headshot Darkness. Be aware that this changes all 3 custom fields, so there's no distinguishment between a bodyshot, headshot, or explosive death. All quotes can be shown for all types.

# PLEASE NOTE
This is just a hollowed out version of the mod path so you can drag and drop just like the actual mod. This means that this does not contain the actual mod
itself and you must download it from here: [Headshot Darkness](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/2164-headshot-darkness/?highlight=headshot)

Please also be aware that you must enable custom death messages in the F12 mod config menu in-game in order for these to work.
